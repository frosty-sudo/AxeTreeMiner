# AxeTreeMiner
Adds an axe that can mine a whole tree with just one swing.


This is a plugin which adds the "Tree Destroyer" tool which is a repurposed diamond axe that can destroy all logs connected together in any cardinal direction. 
To create this incredible tool, five diamonds and two sticks are needed. 
The crafting recipe is the same as any other axe except two more diamonds are needed next to the top most stick.
After acquiring the tool it can be used by sneaking and breaking a log that sits on a block (if the log is suspended in mid air it will not vein mine the rest of the tree).
The tool can be enchanted and combined with any other diamond axe while still maintaining its abilities. It can also be renamed in an anvil if the player wishes to do so.
